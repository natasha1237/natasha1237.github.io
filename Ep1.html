		    <p><span style="color:yellow; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10">The episode</span> starts where "The One with Joey's Big Break" left off. Joey is in Las Vegas, Nevada, working at Caesar's Palace casino as a costumed "atmosphere" character; the film that was going to be his "big break" has been placed on indefinite hiatus. Chandler, who fought with Joey right before his departure over whether it would be Joey's big break, has been trying to apologize by phone, but Joey refuses to let him (particularly since Chandler turned out to be right!). Chandler decides to fly out and visit Joey in person, so Monica buys him two tickets: it's her and Chandler's one-year anniversary ("We can call it our plane-iversary." "Do we have to?"). Phoebe buys in because the last time there was a big trip, everyone "ditched" her ("Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!") Finally, Ross and Rachel get involved, but decide to fly out a day later due to previous engagements. Thus, the entire cast ends up (eventually) in Las Vegas.
			Though Monica is definitely in love with Chandler, she faces a problem: she recently met old flame Richard Burke over lunch, she confesses to Phoebe, and has not been able to tell Chandler in a way that won't inspire intense jealousy. Phoebe, of course, spills the whole deal on the flight over, with predictable repercussions. This culminates in a huge fight and separation ("Happy Anniversary!").   Rachel takes advantage of the empty apartment to act on Phoebe's suggestion and wander around the apartment completely in the nude. Unfortunately, Ross sees her from across the street and assumes she's coming on to him (or, possibly, his entire building). This leads to an awkward conversation in the hall, and then frosty contretemps on the plane the next day.   Finally, Joey spends the entire episode posturing as a gladiator and wishing he had a get-rich-quick scheme, and Phoebe keeps tabs on whether the Las Vegas or London trip is scoring more points. Both of them get more substantial activities in the second-half of the two-part episode, which originally aired right after this one.

			<p><span style="color:yellow; font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10">The episode</span>starts where Part One left off (they were originally aired back-to-back).   Phoebe, having accidentally caused Monica and Chandler to separate on their one-year anniversary, counsels Monica to tell Chandler the truth: that she loves him and not Richard. Monica sets out to do so, but gets sucked into a craps game by accident and (of course) starts winning. Meanwhile, Phoebe sets Chandler looking for Monica to receive her apology, but when he finds the craps table, she is hugging a bystander in joyous celebration. Chandler turns around wordlessly, and the next time he passes the craps table, he's towing his luggage behind. (The suitcase turns out to be empty, merely a prop for his dramatic exit.) 
				After receiving Monica's apology, he joins her at the craps table, calling the numbers she should bet on. He makes increasingly extravagant promises to the crowd, culminating in a bet to Monica: "You roll another hard eight... And we get married here tonight." After a commercial break, Monica agrees. She rolls a four with one die, but the other goes wild and lands beneath the table... On-edge, showing a four on one side and a five on the other. "It's a four," Chandler decides. "I think so too," Monica agrees.   
				Ross and Rachel, on the other hand, are going through their own brand of romance, having recently reminded each other of their failed relationship with each other and now being forced to sit next to each other during the flight west. After inconclusive attempts to out-embarrass each other, Rachel falls asleep on Ross's shoulder, and Ross draws a beard and mustache on her face with a pen. Rachel, of course, doesn't know about it until they meet Phoebe and Joey in the lobby; she storms off to the restrooms, where she discovers that Ross's marker was permanent. She refuses to leave the hotel room 
				("Ross, I am a human doodle!") but still demands the Vegas experience, leading her to eviscerate Ross's mini-bar and leading Ross to "lose" to her repeatedly at blackjack. Eventually they both get roaring drunk, and parade happily around the casino in alcoholic equality: 
				Ross with his face doodled on by Rachel.   Phoebe has to deal with a "lurker"—someone (in this case an elderly woman) who takes slot machines Phoebe has just abandoned and manages to land jackpots with them. She attempts to antagonize the woman into leaving her alone. Meanwhile, Joey discovers his "hand twin"—a man whose hands are identical to Joey's; this man immediately gets drafted into Joey's get-rich-quick scheming. Both Phoebe and Joey are eventually thrown out of the casino.   
				The final scene of the episode finds Chandler and Monica at a Las Vegas wedding chapel: "One marriage, please!" They have to wait, however, as the chapel is currently in use. Finally, its occupants burst out in joyous celebration: Ross and Rachel, still with doodled-on faces, still roaring drunk 
				("Hello Mrs Ross!" "Hello Mr Rachel!"), and now very legally married. They charge out into the night while Chandler and Monica stare.</p>
